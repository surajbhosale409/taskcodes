    The Goal:
    The main goal here is to create a sort of “guess the word using a hint" or "Answer the question" game. The user needs to  be  able to input letter guesses. A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use. This means you’ll need a way to grab a word to use for guessing.
You will also need functions to check if the user has actually input a single letter, to check if the input letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter variable to limit guesses.

Example:
        "First Name" of inventor of C?
         _ _ _ _ _ _
        Guesses Left: 5
        Enter Guess: a (User input)

        "First Name" of inventor of C?
        _ _ _ _ _ _
        Guess Left: 4
        Enter Guess: d

        "First Name" of inventor of C?
        D _ _ _ _ _
        Guess Left: 4
        Enter Guess: n

        "First Name" of inventor of C?
        D _ N N _ _
        Guess Left: 4
        Enter Guess: eis

        "First Name" of inventor of C?
        D E N N I S

        Correct Answer!

    If number of guesses are over, reveal answer.

    Appropriate validations should be made. Make it as interactive as possible.
    Make sure the questions aren't repeated in consecutive runs! (Mujhe bhi nai pata kaise karenge! xD)

    Notes:
    1. Number of guesses and any other rules can be assumed. (Must be stated)
    2. The questions or hints maybe hard coded or input via a file.

Extra:
   1. Build a complete game with n number of questions to win. Difficulty of questions increases every level ofcourse.
  

[3] Guess the Number
    The Goal: The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. You’ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the inputed number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.
    [i] Keep limited number of guess.

[6] BLACKJACK:
    How to play (Rules): http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/

Betting and winning:

Each player at the blackjack table has a circle or box to place bets in. There will always be a minimum bet and a maximum bet for the table. The maximum bet is normally ten to twenty times the minimum bet, meaning that a table with a $5 minimum would have a $50 to $100 maximum. Each player decides how much to bet on a hand before the deal.

Each hand will result in one of the following events for the player:

Lose - the player's bet is taken by the dealer.
Win - the player wins as much as he bet. If you bet $10, you win $10 from the dealer (plus you keep your original bet, of course.)
Blackjack (natural) - the player wins 1.5 times the bet. With a bet of $10, you keep your $10 and win a further $15 from the dealer.
Push - the hand is a draw. The player keeps his bet, neither winning nor losing money.
