The Goal:
    The main goal here is to create a sort of “guess the word using a hint" or "Answer the question" game. The user needs to be able to input letter guesses. A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use. This means you’ll need a way to grab a word to use for guessing.
You will also need functions to check if the user has actually input a single letter, to check if the input letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter variable to limit guesses.

Example:
  "First Name" of inventor of C?
    _ _ _ _ _ _
Guesses Left: 5
Enter Guess: a (User input)

"First Name" of inventor of C?
    _ _ _ _ _ _
Guess Left: 4
Enter Guess: d

"First Name" of inventor of C?
    D _ _ _ _ _
Guess Left: 4
Enter Guess: n

"First Name" of inventor of C?
    D _ N N _ _
Guess Left: 4
Enter Guess: eis

"First Name" of inventor of C?
    D E N N I S

Correct Answer!

If number of guesses are over, reveal answer.

Appropriate validations should be made. Make it as interactive as possible.
Make sure the questions aren't repeated in consecutive runs! (Mujhe bhi nai pata kaise karenge! xD)

Notes:
    1. Number of guesses and any other rules can be assumed. (Must be stated)
    2. The questions or hints maybe hard coded or input via a file.

Extra:
   1. Build a complete game with n number of questions to win. Difficulty of questions increases every level ofcourse.
